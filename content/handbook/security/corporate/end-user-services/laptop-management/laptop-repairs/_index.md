**Any loss or damage must be reported to IT as soon as it occurs.**

If your laptop has been damaged, you must open an issue in the [End User Services Issue Tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/it/end-user-services/issues/laptop-issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Laptop_Repair) to document what is broken. GitLab IT will be able to help assess the damage and provide guidance on the most beneficial repair option.

## Repair options

In some regions, GitLab IT has an Apple certified vendor to perform repairs. At GitLab IT's discretion and vendor availability, the broken laptop may be sent to the vendor for repair. Our GitLab IT team can check if vendor support is available in your region. For minor repairs or when vendor support isn't an option, they may suggest visiting an Apple authorized service center in your area.

Estimates or quotes from an Apple authorized service center must be included in the issue before approval. Approval must be given by IT and your manager **prior** to any repair work being done. Either a picture or PDF are acceptable and should include some identifying information about the laptop (serial number, year, make, model). If the quote for the repair is less than $1,000 USD, and can be completed within a short time frame, GitLab IT may recommend/approve the Apple authorized service center to complete the work. If the repair is going to take longer than a day, make sure you have a back up laptop that uses an approved OS.

If the repair is going to be more than $1,000 USD and/or take too long to fix, GitLab IT may decide to replace the laptop. In those cases, a replacement laptop will be shipped out and the broken laptop collected to be repaired or recycled. If IT confirms the laptop needs to be replaced, please create [an issue for the replacement](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/it/end-user-services/issues/laptop-issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Laptop_Replacement) and link it to the laptop repair issue. When you receive the new laptop, please follow the guidelines in the replacement template.

Broken laptops do not qualify for the [Laptop Buyback Policy](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/laptop-management/laptop-offboarding-returns/#laptop-buybacks) and will need to be returned to GitLab IT. Replacements for broken laptops may lightly used, but will be the same model of laptop (a performance model wouldn't be replaced by a standard model).
