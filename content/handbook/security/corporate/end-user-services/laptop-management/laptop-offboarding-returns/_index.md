title: "Laptop Offboarding and Returns"
---

In cases where a team member does not qualify to keep the GitLab issued laptop, we may request the device to be returned to GitLab stock, or offer the option to buy it at a reduced cost. We also offer options in cases where a member is eligible to keep their old laptop but may choose not to.

### Laptop Offboarding

At GitLab’s discretion, company issued devices may be retained at no cost under the following conditions:

* The laptop has been in use at least three years and a refresh is approved
* A team member has received permission from EUS to keep their old laptop in the case of an early replacement
* A former team member has had the laptop in active use for at least one year at the time of their offboarding
* A former team member has received approval from PeopleOps and EUS to keep their old laptop in cases where the device has been in use for less than one year at the time of offboarding

All retained laptops must be wiped by EUS before we can transfer ownership of the device. Please see the [Laptop Wipe](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/laptop-management/laptop-wipe/) page for more details

### Laptop Returns

At GitLab’s discretion, we may request company issued devices be returned under the following conditions:

* A member has had the laptop for less than one year at the time of their offboarding
* A member was found to be in violation of their employment terms at the time of their offboarding
* A member is involved in cases of investigation, misconduct, termination for cause, any violation of GitLab’s Code of Business Conduct & Ethics, or other legal or security related inquiries. 
* If the EUS team has been notified of a current hold for the offboarded team member, we will need to consult internally before proceeding.
* Approved laptop replacements where the old laptop is less than three years old

EUS will need to confirm current shipping address, phone number and user's availability to facilitate the return. GitLab will cover all costs associated with a return and can provide a return kit unless requested otherwise. You may also purchase a cardboard box with packing foam before your last day and expense it in Navan under Office supplies & consumables. IT will provide a prepaid shipping label to return the laptop. 

> In the case of hardware returns, our vendors may reach out directly for additional information or requests.

### Laptop Buybacks

>The option to purchase or to keep a laptop at no cost may be voided where the team member is involved in cases of investigation, misconduct, termination for cause, any violation of [GitLab’s Code of Business Conduct & Ethics](https://ir.gitlab.com/static-files/7d8c7eb3-cb17-4d68-a607-1b7a1fa1c95d), or other legal or security related inquiries.

If the team member has not completed 1 calendar year at the time of offboarding or has received a laptop refresh within the past year, they have the option, at GitLab’s discretion, to purchase their laptop for current market value from GitLab. If the laptop has been used by the team member for more than one year at the time of offboarding, they can, at GitLab’s discretion, opt to keep their laptop at no cost. Subject to promptly working with the company during the offboarding process to enable the laptop to be wiped and, when required by applicable legal obligations, imaged for preservation purposes. If GitLab needs to create an image of the team member's computer for preservation purposes, that may be accomplished via sending the computer to GitLab Corporate Security via prepaid package or remotely via [Backblaze](/handbook/security/corporate/systems/backblaze/).

If the team member would like to purchase the laptop, and the company has agreed, they will need to send an email to laptops@gitlab.com to start the process. If purchasing, our Manager of IT, or Lead IT Analyst can approve, and send the team member an email with the determined value. If the team member decides to move forward with purchasing, our accounting department will reach out with payment information.

If the departing team member opts not to keep or [donate](#laptop-donations) their laptop, they can [return](#laptop-returns) it to GitLab.

**If the team member is under an active Legal Hold or possesses material related to an active Company investigation, they must comply with the notice requirements. Failure to comply with an active Legal Hold may expose the team member or the Company to adverse consequences, including civil or criminal penalties and sanctions. Their obligation to follow the procedures outlined in the notice continues until the hold is lifted, even if they depart the Company. If the team member departs the Company, all Company devices and any material they're holding in accordance with any active Legal Hold Notice or active Company investigation should be turned over upon their departure.**

### Laptop Donations

Hardware donations help bridge the digital divide by providing technology learning access to people in disadvantaged areas and underrepresented groups. GitLab offers the option to donate used devices to [vendors on a curated list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15g4v5coC_yLlVNTKUZMwATllZhxzqbxrtvwJsi8bjXE/edit#gid=0) after 3 years of use. This curated list has been a result of the [Upstream Diversity Working Group](/handbook/company/working-groups/upstream-diversity/).

The vendors on the list have been meeting the following criteria:

* Their focus group should be people in disadvantaged areas and/or underrepresented groups
* They should be non-profit
* Their values have to align with GitLab's CREDIT values
* They should pass a "negative-press" check (first 2 pages of Google)

If you, as a GitLab team member, would like to add a vendor aligned with the criteria, please comment in the [Vendor sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15g4v5coC_yLlVNTKUZMwATllZhxzqbxrtvwJsi8bjXE/edit#gid=0).
