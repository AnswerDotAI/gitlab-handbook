title: Laptop Ordering
---

The CorpSec Helpdesk team handles the process for all laptops orders. Self procurement is only available if you are in a region where we are not able to have a laptop delivered.

## Shipping Locations

Team members that live in these countries can be serviced via the IT Laptop Ordering Process:

North America, most of the EU, the UK, Thailand, Japan, Philippines, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, India, Israel, Costa Rica, South Korea.

We are adding supported countries as we expand our vendor relationships globally.
We currently cannot procure laptops for Brazil, Chile, Armenia, or Ukraine.

If a team member's country is not listed above or for any general laptop procurement questions please contact laptops@gitlab.com or your Candidate Experience Specialist to discuss alternate options.
If the team member requires financial assistance to purchase the hardware, the Company can advance the funds to help facilitate the purchase (see Exception Processes below).

## Laptop Purchasing and Shipping Process

After End User Services receives your laptop order, we will start working on the request. New hires can expect their GitLab laptop to arrive the week before their start date. We leverage business relationships with different vendors across the globe to accomplish this remotely. Please note delivery times will vary depending on location, hardware supply, vendor selection, and shipping method.

>Our performance KPI targets over 90% of new hire laptops delivered before their start date.Metrics are tracked internally on this [handbook page](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/it/end-user-services/gitlab-laptop-metrics/)

## New Hire Laptop Ordering Process

The laptop ordering process for new hires starts once the initial welcome email is sent by the Candidate Experience Specialist. The email will include a link to request a GitLab issued laptop. Please fill out the form as soon as possible to avoid delays.

Once the new hire fills out the form, they can expect their laptop to arrive the week before their start date. We leverage business relationships with several vendors across the globe to accomplish this remotely. **Please note: delivery times will vary depending on location, hardware supply, vendor selection, and shipping method.**

In some instances, we may be able to work out priority or overnight delivery. We will not be able to service this for all cases and regions. If this is needed please reach out to `laptops@gitlab.com` or talk with your Candidate Experience Specialist to review all options available.

If you are a hiring manager or member of the hiring/recruiting team, you may check the status and content of a new hires order in the [IT Equipment Order Process Project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/it/end-user-services/issues/it-equipment-order-processing/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=all&first_page_size=100)

Minimum processing time for laptop requests before shipping. Some countries may take longer due to required documentation for delivery.

* North America New Hires - 2 weeks (Apple) and 5 weeks (Linux)
* EMEA/APAC New Hires - 2 weeks (Apple) and 5 weeks (Linux)
* Other Regions - 3 weeks (Apple) and 9 weeks (Linux)

Should a laptop not be available to a new GitLab team member upon their start date, the hiring manager or a member of the hiring/recruiting team must request a [security exception](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/security-compliance-commercial-and-dedicated/exceptions/-/issues/new?description_template=exception_request) for the new hire to temporarily use a personal macOS or Linux laptop.

If in the rare case your laptop arrives damaged or unusable prior to your start date, please reach out to your Candidate Experience Specialist and CC [laptops@gitlab.com](mailto:laptops@gitlab.com) for next steps on an immediate replacement or repair.

## Laptop Refreshes

> **Note**: In most cases, we will prioritize new hire laptop orders over refreshes. Refreshes may be delayed, depending on stock availability.

Team members are eligible for a refreshed laptop after 3 years of active use. The 3 year period:

* Begins when a team member starts actively using their assigned laptop, not necessarily when it was first received
* Resets when a replacement laptop is issued due to damage, malfunction, or other circumstances
* Is based on the device's usage period, not the team member's employment duration

If the laptop is sufficient for your needs, you may opt to continue using the laptop until it no longer receives the latest macOS version from Apple (approximately 5 years).

Please use [this template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/it/end-user-services/issues/laptop-issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Laptop_Refresh_Upgrade) to request a laptop refresh.

The old laptop must be [wiped](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/laptop-management/laptop-wipe/) or [returned](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/laptop-management/laptop-offboarding-returns/#laptop-returns) **within 2 weeks of receiving the replacement laptop**. We recommend using [AirDrop](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/use-airdrop-to-send-items-to-nearby-devices) or [Google Drive](/handbook/tools-and-tips/#adding-google-drive-to-your-mac) to transfer files directly from the old to the new MacBook.

> **If GitLab discovers that a device has not been wiped according to policy, GitLab may act to enforce a remote lock/wipe without notice.**

After 3 years of use, the team member may retain the laptop at no cost after a wipe has been completed. The option to keep a laptop at no cost may be voided where the team member is involved in cases of investigation, misconduct, termination for cause, any violation of [GitLabâ€™s Code of Business Conduct & Ethics](https://ir.gitlab.com/static-files/7d8c7eb3-cb17-4d68-a607-1b7a1fa1c95d), as well as other legal or security related inquiries. Please also refer to our [Laptop Buyback Policy](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/laptop-management/laptop-offboarding-returns/#laptop-buybacks).

## Laptop Replacements

We get it, sometimes things change! If your laptop is not sufficient for your role, you can request a replacement laptop if you are not yet eligible for a 3 year refresh. Replaced laptops do not qualify for Laptop Buyback and will need to be returned to be repurposed at GitLab IT's discretion.

Replacement laptops can be requested by [creating an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/it/end-user-services/issues/laptop-issue-tracker/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Laptop_Replacement) in the End User Services issue tracker project. Please describe the reason for your replacement request in the issue. (laptop is not sufficient for job duties, internal transfer to a new role, etc)

**Replacements will require approval from IT as well as your manager within the issue.**

## Exception Processes

Most laptop orders will fall under the standard ordering processes. However, we do account for non-standard requests that may pop-up occasionally and require additional steps and approvals.

### Laptops Out of Spec

If a requested laptop is outside the standard specifications listed [here](/handbook/security/corporate/end-user-services/laptop-management/#laptop-specs), approval will be required from the team member's manager as well as the Device Logistics Team before IT will purchase the laptop. Once your manager has approved, please tag `@gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/logistics` for logistics approval. 

### Self procurement

**Cost will not be covered by GitLab without proper approval**

IT approval is required for self procurement of laptops. Self procurement is only available if you are in a region where we are not able to have a laptop delivered. If the team member desires financial assistance to purchase the hardware, GitLab can advance the funds to help facilitate the purchase. See the handbook page for [Temporary Advances](/handbook/finance/expenses/#team-member-expense-temporary-advances). For current team members, please obtain two quotes from local retailers (online or physical) and include them in the refresh/replacement issue.

IT must verify the laptop specs and cost before approval is given. The created issue will be verified by the AP team to release funds.

>Laptops paid for or reimbursed by the company are property of GitLab. They must be enrolled using the proper Endpoint Management System for accurate [asset tracking](/handbook/finance/accounting/#fixed-asset-register-and-asset-tracking).
Since these items are company property, you do not need to buy insurance for them.

### Additional Laptop Request

If you are in need of a additional device, have a business justification, have manager approval and IT approval, you can request an additional laptop through the [Laptop Refresh/Upgrade template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/it/end-user-services/issues/laptop-issue-tracker/-/issues/new#). Please note that if the secondary device is approved it will be a refurbished device and not a new device.

### Use of Personal Laptop

We do not allow personal laptops to be used for GitLab work. If a laptop is not available to a new GitLab team member upon their start date, it is permissable for them to temporarily use a personal macOS or Linux laptop.

### Laptop exceptions not listed

Any circumstance that falls outside of the listed exceptions or if GitLab IT deems it necessary, a Laptop Exception can be created using this [template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/security-compliance-commercial-and-dedicated/exceptions/-/issues/new?issuable_template=exception_request). These requests require approval from leadership across multiple departments and are discouraged due to the possibility of data leakage.
