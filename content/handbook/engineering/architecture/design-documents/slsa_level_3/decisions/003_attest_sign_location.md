title: "ADR 003: Generate and sign SLSA attestation in glgo"
description: "Architecture Decision Record for where to generate and sign SLSA attestations."
---

## Context

SLSA (Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts) is a security framework that helps ensure the integrity of software artifacts. As part of implementing SLSA Level 3 compliance, GitLab needs to generate signed attestations for artifacts produced by CI/CD pipelines with provenance generated by GitLab. The final output is a Sigstore bundle which can be used to verify the provenance of an artifact.

Currently, SLSA attestations can be generated in the GitLab Runner. However, this approach doesn't meet SLSA Level 3 requirements, which specify that atteststations must be generated and signed by the control plane (within the trust boundary) and not by a tenant of the build platform.

This ADR documents the decision on where to generate and sign SLSA attestations within GitLab's architecture.

## Options Considered

### 1. CI/CD component (Current Implementation)

**Pros:**

- Visibility: advertised in the CI/CD catalog
- Maintenance: new releases can be published at any time
- Cosign integration: it's possible to run the cosign CLI, which is the reference implementation
- KMS integration: see [Using external secrets in CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ci/secrets/)

**Cons**

- Components must be mirrored in order to be using with self-managed or Dedicated instances.

**Blockers:**

- Not in control plane.

### 2. Runner

**Pros:**

- Cosign integration: it's possible to run the cosign CLI, which is the reference implementation

**Blockers:**

- Not in control plane.

### 3. GitLab Rails

**Pros:**

- Deployment and maintenance: it ships with GitLab
- Easy setup: can be enabled in GitLab UI
- Compliance: can be enforced regardless of what's defined in the CI/CD configuration file
in control plane (as defined by SLSA)

**Cons:**

- Unlike CI/CD jobs the backend can't execute commands like `cosign`
- Would require the signing to be done in Ruby, and the [sigstore-ruby](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-ruby) gem isn't mature enough, and does not support signing (although [code](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-ruby/blob/main/lib/sigstore/signer.rb) does exist).

### 4. glgo

**Pros:**

- Very good isolation.
- It's already being deployed as part of gitLab.com
- Communication b/w glgo and the Rails backend is secured using tokens.
- We can integrate [sigstore-go](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-go) or [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign).
- Can interact with OpenBao and other KMS.

**Cons:**

- We can't directly support self-managed distribution. However, by open sourcing glgo and providing deployment instructions, we provide a path forward for these customers.

## Decision

**We will generate and sign SLSA attestations in glgo.**

This option gives us the fastest path to production for gitlab.com while still providing a path forward for self-managed customers.

## Consequences

### Positive

- SLSA Level 3 compliance is achievable.
- Attestation generation and signing can be delivered for gitlab.com customers
- No additional services or infrastructure required.

### Negative

- glgo is not included for self-managed or Dedicated customers today, and additional effort will be required to make it available in the future.
