Skip Levels with [Michelle](/handbook/company/team/#m_gill) occur in 3 ways:

1. Each month, skip level invites will be sent to approximately 10 team members depending on availability across teams. This equates to 1 skip level approximately every 6 months, therefore invites are sent based on the last meeting date.
1. Monthly placeholder events are pre-scheduled in all regions also at that time and can be "claimed" on [this calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=Y191YmNqOXEzN3UxbjlsbnUwY29lajg5cGYzY0Bncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) (internal only) by any engineer or engineering manager. If you don't see any - they are taken, follow step 3.
1. Michelle is never too busy for a skip level. Simply schedule one. ðŸ™‚
